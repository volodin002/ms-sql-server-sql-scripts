Script to Monitor SQL Server Memory Usage: Top Performance Counters – Memory

Results:

Total Server Memory: Shows how much memory SQL Server is using. The primary use of SQL Server’s memory is for the buffer pool, but some memory is also used for storing query plans and keeping track of user process information.

Target Server Memory: This value shows how much memory SQL Server attempts to acquire. If you haven’t configured a max server memory value for SQL Server, the target amount of memory will be about 5MB less than the total available system memory.

Connection Memory (GB): The Connection Memory specifies the total amount of dynamic memory the server is using for maintaining connections

Lock Memory (GB): Shows the total amount of memory the server is using for locks

SQL Cache Memory: Total memory reserved for dynamic SQL statements.

Optimizer Memory: Memory reserved for query optimization.

Granted Workspace Memory: Total amount of memory currently granted to executing processes such as hash, sort, bulk copy, and index creation operations.

Cursor memory usage: Memory using for cursors

Free pages: Amount of free space in pages which are commited but not currently using by SQL Server

Reserved Pages: Shows the number of buffer pool reserved pages.

Stolen pages (MB): Memory used by SQL Server but not for Database pages.It is used for sorting or hashing operations, or “as a generic memory store for allocations to store internal data structures such as locks, transaction context, and connection information.

Cache Pages: Number of 8KB pages in cache.

Page life expectancy: Average how long each data page is staying in buffer cache before being flushed out to make room for other pages

Free list stalls / sec: Number of times a request for a “free” page had to wait for one to become available.

Checkpoint Pages/sec: Checkpoint Pages/sec shows the number of pages that are moved from buffer to disk per second during a checkpoint process

Lazy writes / sec: How many times per second lazy writer has to flush dirty pages out of the buffer cache instead of waiting on a checkpoint.

Memory Grants Outstanding: Number of processes that have successfully acquired workspace memory grant.

Memory Grants Pending: Number of processes waiting on a workspace memory grant.

process_physical_memory_low: Process is responding to low physical memory notification

process_virtual_memory_low: Indicates that low virtual memory condition has been detected

Min Server Memory: Minimum amount of memory SQL Server should acquire

Max Server Memory: Maximum memory that SQL Server can acquire from OS

Buffer cache hit ratio: Percentage of pages that were found in the buffer pool without having to incur a read from disk.

Analysis:

Total Server Memory is almost same as Target Server Memory: Good Health

Total Server Memory is much smaller than Target Server Memory: There is a Memory Pressure or Max Server Memory is set to too low.

Connection Memory: When high, check the number of user connections and make sure it’s under expected value as per your business

Optimizer Memory: Ideally, the value should remain relatively static. If this isn’t the case you might be using dynamic SQL execution excessively.

Higher the value for Stolen Pages: Find the costly queries / procs and tune them

Higher the value for Checkpoint Pages/sec: Problem with I/O, Do not depend on Automatic Checkpoints and use In-direct checkpoints.

Page life expectancy: Usually 300 to 400 sec for each 4 GB of memory. Lesser the value means memory pressure

Free list stalls / sec: High value indicates that the server could use additional memory.

Memory Grants Outstanding: Higher value indicates peak user activity

Memory Grants Pending: Higher value indicates SQL Server need more memory

process_physical_memory_low & process_virtual_memory_low: Both are equals to 0 means no internal memory pressure

Min Server Memory: If it is 0 means default value didnt get changed, it’ll always be better to have a minimum amount of memory allocated to SQL Server

Max Server Memory: If it is default to 2147483647, change the value with the correct amount of memory that you can allow SQL Server to utilize.

Buffer cache hit ratio: This ratio should be in between 95 and 100. Lesser value indicates memory pressure
